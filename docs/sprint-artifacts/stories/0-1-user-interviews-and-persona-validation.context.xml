      **Quality Checks:**
      - Review interview script with one team member before starting
      - Pilot interview with one friendly participant to refine questions
      - Mid-interview checkpoint: Review notes after 3 interviews, adjust approach if needed
      - Final validation: Present findings to product team for feedback
    </locations>

    <ideas>
      **Research Validation Ideas:**

      1. **Self-Identification Exercise:**
         - Present 5 personas to participants
         - Ask: "Which persona best describes you?"
         - Success: 80%+ participants identify with one persona
         - If <80%: Refine personas based on mismatches

      2. **Triangulation with Stakeholders:**
         - Present refined personas to 2-3 team leaders
         - Ask: "Can you map real team members to these personas?"
         - Success: Stakeholders agree personas are accurate and actionable

      3. **Feature Prioritization Alignment:**
         - Map user-mentioned features to PRD FR1-FR10
         - Ensure top features align with planned scope
         - Success: No major gaps or unexpected high-priority requests

      4. **Pain Point Frequency:**
         - Track how many participants mention each pain point
         - Success: Top 5 pain points mentioned by 50%+ participants
         - Prioritize addressing top pain points in Epic 3 (UI Core)

      5. **Usage Pattern Validation:**
         - Identify most-used features (daily workflows)
         - Ensure these are prominent in Story 2-6 implementations
         - Success: Dashboard, agents, execution history = top 3 pages

      6. **Mobile Requirements:**
         - Ask about mobile usage frequency and use cases
         - Success: Understand which features need mobile optimization
         - Feed into responsive design priorities (Story 2)
