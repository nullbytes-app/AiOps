## Roadmap Principles

### 1. Goal-Driven & Feature-Driven Balance (2025 Best Practice)

**Goal-Driven (70%):** Focus on strategic objectives (client onboarding, time reduction, revenue)
**Feature-Driven (30%):** Respond to client feedback and market demands

**Application:**
- Epic 6 (Admin UI): Goal-driven (enables multi-tenant scaling)
- RCA Agent: Feature-driven (client feedback)
- Epic 7 (Plugin Architecture): Goal-driven (market expansion)

### 2. Validated Learning & Iteration

**Principle:** Ship, measure, learn, iterate

**Application:**
- Epic 6 → Measure: Tenant onboarding time reduction
- RCA Agent → Measure: Technician rating, time savings
- Epic 7 → Measure: Multi-tool adoption rate, sales pipeline

### 3. Technical Debt Budget (20-30% per Sprint)

**Principle:** Maintain strong technical foundation (2025 best practice: 20-30% debt allocation)

**Application:**
- 10 high-priority debt items (from Technical Debt Register) → 5 sprints (10 weeks)
- Parallel to epic development (not separate debt sprints)

### 4. Team Velocity-Based Planning

**Baseline Velocity:** 42 stories in 4 weeks = 10.5 stories/week (MVP delivery)

**Adjusted Velocity (Conservative):**
- Account for:
  - Onboarding time (new team members)
  - Context switching (support, bug fixes)
  - Technical debt paydown (20% allocation)
- **Adjusted:** 7-8 stories/week (~35 stories/month)

**Validation:** Re-assess after Epic 6 (Q4 2025)

### 5. Treat Roadmap as Living Document

**Principle:** Update roadmap quarterly based on retrospectives and market feedback

**Review Cadence:**
- **Monthly:** Progress check, risk assessment
- **Quarterly:** Retrospective, roadmap adjustment, reprioritization
- **Annually:** Strategic planning, multi-year vision

## Risk Register & Contingency Plans

### High-Impact Risks

#### R1: RCA Agent Accuracy <70%

**Probability:** Medium (40%)
**Impact:** High (blocks Q1 milestone)

**Mitigation:**
- Allocate 2-week buffer for prompt tuning (Sprint 6)
- Domain expert review (MSP technician feedback)
- A/B testing with different prompt strategies

**Contingency Plan:**
- If accuracy <70% after Sprint 7 → Defer RCA Agent to Q2, prioritize Epic 7 completion

#### R2: Client Onboarding Bottleneck

**Probability:** High (50%)
**Impact:** Medium (slows revenue growth)

**Mitigation:**
- Hire Customer Success Manager (Q1 2026)
- Create self-service onboarding flow (Epic 6 UI)
- Allocate 2 days/client onboarding (realistic estimate)

**Contingency Plan:**
- If onboarding exceeds capacity → Pause new sales until Q2, focus on existing client success

#### R3: Technical Debt Accumulation

**Probability:** Medium (30%)
**Impact:** High (slows future development)

**Mitigation:**
- Maintain 20% technical debt allocation (non-negotiable)
- Mid-epic checkpoints (after 50%, 80% stories)
- Debt register reviewed monthly

**Contingency Plan:**
- If debt accumulates >15 items → Declare "Debt Sprint" (1 full sprint, 0% feature work)

### Medium-Impact Risks

#### R4: Jira API Complexity

**Probability:** Medium (30%)
**Impact:** Medium (delays Epic 7)

**Mitigation:**
- Spike story (1 week) to explore Jira API complexity before Sprint 10
- Allocate 7 days for Story 7.4 (vs. 5 days originally estimated)

**Contingency Plan:**
- If Jira plugin exceeds 7 days → Defer to Q2, focus on ServiceDesk Plus stability

#### R5: Team Attrition

**Probability:** Low (20%)
**Impact:** High (capacity reduction)

**Mitigation:**
- Knowledge sharing (pair programming, code reviews)
- Comprehensive documentation (operational guides, architecture docs)
- Cross-training (backend engineers can work on any epic)

**Contingency Plan:**
- If team member leaves → Hire replacement immediately, reduce epic scope by 20% for 1 quarter
